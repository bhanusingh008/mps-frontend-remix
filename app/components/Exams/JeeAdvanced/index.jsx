          <div>
            The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) - Advanced is an annual
            academic exam conducted in India, overseen by the Joint Admission
            Board (JAB). It is organized by one of the seven zonal IITs each
            year—namely IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Guwahati, IIT Kanpur, IIT
            Kharagpur, IIT Madras, and IIT Roorkee. Candidates who qualify
            through JEE-Main (except for foreign nationals who are exempt) can
            appear for JEE Advanced. This examination opens pathways for
            students to pursue undergraduate and integrated programs, including
            bachelor's and master's dual degree courses. Admission to premier
            engineering and architecture programs is granted to eligible
            candidates. The exam is conducted in an online, center-based format.
            JEE Advanced consists of two mandatory papers, Paper 1 and Paper 2,
            each of which lasts three hours. Both papers are required for
            evaluation. This guide provides aspiring candidates with important
            information regarding the JEE Advanced 2024 syllabus, eligibility
            criteria, exam pattern, application process, key dates, and more.
            The program aims to equip students with the knowledge and
            preparation necessary to excel in this highly competitive exam.
